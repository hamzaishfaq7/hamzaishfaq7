Hi there! 

My name is Hamza Ishfaq. I am currently a Banking Professional working at TD Canada Trust. I want to make a transition to the Technology industry.
It really does capture my imagination. I really want to be able to take whats in my mind and put it on all kinds of screens. 
I am currently teaching myself, making projects. Come take a look.
I am open to any advice. 
Thanks for reading!
